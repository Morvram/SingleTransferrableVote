    #districts = a list (1d) of district names
    #numVoters = a list (1d) of the number of voters in each district.
    #candidatesPerDistrict = a list (2d) of lists of candidates, of equal length.
    #choiceVotesForCandidate = a list (3d):
        #1st layer: one list corresponding to each district.
        #2nd layer one list corresponding to each candidate in that district.
        #3rd layer number of votes at first, second, third etc. choice.

    #For each district, create the district object using:
    i = 0
    while i < len(districts):
        name = districts[i]
        print("Moving through " + name)

        #3) OK this one's more complicated:
            #(1) Create a list voters[] of Voter objects of length equal to the total number of first-choice votes that exist in the district,
            # with empty lists as their contents


            # (2) For each Voter in that list, append a first choice candidate. If the first candidate has 754 first-choice votes,
            # the first 754
            #Voter objects will have that candidate inserted as their first choice.
                # An aside on this: basically, we'll be setting the first choice of the Voter in the i spot of the list of voters,
                # while i < choiceVotesForCandidate[currentDistrict][i][0].
                # 0 in this case should be the initial value for j, which corresponds to choice number -1.
                #Voter.votes[j] = candidatesPerDistrict[currentDistrict][k]
                #Where k is the index of the candidate we're currently on (i will have to reset each time we increment k)

                #YEAH OKAY THIS IS COMPLICATED BUT INTERESTING.

            #Do the same for second choice, third choice, etc etc until the end
